# seejwork
Work for SW on his proposal

10/01/2019: First draft upload.
Jupyter notebook for data analysis: SEEJwork_meta.ipynb
Edited rosat archive positions file to remove carriage return issue: rosarchive_final_fix_carraige_return.pos
The TESS transit crossing events TCE files for regions 1 and 2:  tess_tce_sector[1,2]
The TCE files are all the candidate planet crossings detected by the current TESS reduction pipeline. Way better than what I can do on short notice! :) 
ROSAT has a positional accuracy of 10-20" and a resolution of ~60"

RESULTS:
There are no matches between the TCE sources and the ROSAT sources in the archive within 60".
Closest is ~200"

Will continue with the XMM Slew Survey and Chandra archives to see if there is anything there.
